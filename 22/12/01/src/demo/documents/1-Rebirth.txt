Opening chants. The Shinigami Realm is shown. Ryuk is sitting on a rock, Rem is resting, and Zellogi is scratching his back with his scythe.


Gook

What. A pair of sleeping skulls?


Deridovely

Hehe, I win again! No hard feelings, right?


Gook

Hey there, Ryuk, would it kill you to join us? You should come play with us for a change!


Ryuk

No, I'll pass.




Light's classroom


English teacher

Listen for the voice of God then follow it and know that in time you will find your salvation.


Talking Girl 1

I know, I didn't even do anything wrong! He just totally snapped at me!


Talking Girl 2

Really?


Teacher

Yagami, are you still with us? Can you please translate the following sentence into English?


Light

[Sigh] Follow the teachings of God and receive his blessings and so it shall be that the seas will again become bountiful and the raging storms will subside.




News are being broadcasted, then Light is shown walking home.


Newscaster

Today, at approximately 11 am a 32-year-old man was found stabbed to death in his apartment in the city of Yokohama Karigara Prefecture. Karigawa police are treating this case as a homicide.


Newscaster 2

In other news, today, suspected murderer Naoki Tokuji was arrested in the district of Shibuya Tokyo. He is being held in custody facing murder charges for the brutal slaying of his common-law partner, who was only 25 at the time of death.


Light

Day in and day out, the same news on permanent repeat.


Ryuk

This is all so ridiculous.


Light

This world is…


Ryuk

Rotten.




Next day at school


Teacher

Another noticeable consequence is the extinction of many species on the planet. Species are now becoming extinct at a faster rate than has ever occurred in our recorded history.


Chatting boy

No way! You paged [unintelligible]




Death Note falls from the sky, indistinct chattering of students. Light notices and walks outside to pick it up.


Light

Death Note? As in a notebook of death? Hmm. How to use it: the human whose name is written in this notebook… shall die! Hmm. It's pretty lame, not to mention twisted. It's really not that different from one of those chain letters you get. A human whose name is written in this notebook shall die? Come on.




Train whistle


Light

There must be something wrong with me to even consider it. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his or her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds. Hmm, so depending on the person you have in mind you can either kill them easily or painfully, huh. This is pretty detailed for a prank, I'll give them that. Hmm… so I write a name and that person… dies. Like anyone would believe that. Ugh! Wait, on the off chance someone really dies, would that make me a murderer? Yeah right, it's completely impossible.


Newscaster 3

The same assailant who attacked 6 people at a busy shopping district in Sinjuku yesterday has struck again, taking 8 people hostage at this daycare center. His captives include both children and teachers. The police have now identified the suspect as 42-year-old Kuro Otoharada, currently unemployed. We expect negotiations to begin immediately.




Light writes the name of the suspect.


Light

Hmm, a heart attack in 40 seconds? We'll see.


Newscaster 3

At the present time, that's all the police are telling us.


Newscaster 4

You can't help but feel concerned for the safety of those hostages.


Newscaster 3

You're absolutely right. We'll continue to monitor the situation from here.


Newscaster 4

Thank you for that report. What do you make of this, Mr. Hashimoto?


Mr. Hashimoto

Well, one can only hope for a quick resolution to this situation.


Light

Looks like the notebook doesn't work. Oh well, I didn't expect it to anyway.


Newscaster 4

Wait, we're seeing something here! Looks like there's movement at the front entrance!


Newscaster 3

The hostages are coming out, and they all look to be unharmed! The Special Forces are taking action; they're moving in! We don't know if the suspect's been arrested. Huh? Yes? Ok, we now have confirmation. The suspect has been found dead inside! I repeat, the suspect is now dead!


Light

Dead?


Newscaster 3

The Special Forces are denying allegations that they shot the suspect.


Newscaster 4

So, it's quite possible he was feeling cornered and decided to commit suicide?


Newscaster 3

Well, according to statements from hostages the suspect just suddenly collapsed.


Light

A heart attack? No way! It's coincidence! This has to be a coincidence!


Sachiko

Light! It's already 6:30, you know! Don't you have cram school tonight?


Light

Yeah, I'll be ready in just a sec. The Death Note, it's unlikely, but if by chance this thing is for real, I have to test it one more time. In which case, it should probably be another criminal. But if he's too well-known, that will be a problem. If he dies, there's a good possibility that news of his death will be covered up. I need to see results right away.




Classroom


Sudou

Hey, Ryo buddy.


Ryo

What is it, Sudou?


Sudou

Didn't you want to lend me 20 dollars?


Ryo

What, again? But I can't do that.


Light

Sudou…


Sudou

You can't…


Light

Maybe I should try killing him. No, I should definitely avoid killing people I know. Then again, does it even really matter? I mean, would anyone really care if I guy like him was to disappear one day?


Sudou

Sweet, looks like we'll be hanging at the arcade after school.




Street


Random Street Girl 1

We're having a speed dating party tomorrow, you wanna come?


Random Street Girl 2

Yeah, of course.


Random Street Girl 3

Oh yeah, there's no way I'm missing that.


Ryo

Dammit, why is my mom so useless! She's never here to pick me up on time!


Light

Once you actually start looking around, it makes you wonder if you'd be doing society a favor by getting rid of all these people.


Takuo

Hey baby, where you going? Come have a little fun with us!


Henchman 1

That's our Takuo for ya. This guy can spot a hottie a mile away.


Takuo

What's up, little lady? The name's Takuo Shibuimaru. What do ya say? Come hang out with us, pretty lady.


Lady

Please, I don't want any trouble.


Henchman 1

You hear that? She doesn't want trouble.


Henchman 2

Isn't that cute.


Takuo

Let's go, boys. Strip her down right here.


Henchman 1

Are you sure?


Lady

No! Stop! Please! Help me!




Light writes Takuo's name.


Light

Now, what will happen?


Takuo

Hey, wait up!


Henchman 2

Takuo, look out!




Lady screams after Takuo is killed by a truck.


Light

[Gasp] That settles it. The Death Note, it's for real!


Henchman 1

Oh man! Takuo!


Henchman 2

Stupid kid, he just came outta nowhere! Arrgh!




Back at the Shinigami Realm


Ryuk

Now then, I'd better get going.




Commercial break


Ryuk

It's been five days. Now then, I'd better get going.


Deridovely

Eh? You headed somewhere, Ryuk?


Gook

Hate to tell you, but our whole world looks like this.


Ryuk

That's true, but I've dropped my Death Note.




Laughter


Deridovely

You really messed things up, didn't you?


Gook

Hold on a sec. Didn't you already trick the Old Man to get a second book? Don't tell me you dropped both of them.


Deridovely

You must have some idea where you dropped the thing?


Ryuk

Yeah, the human world.


Deridovely & Gook

What?!




Exits Shinigami Realm and enters Human World. Thunder cracks, wings flap.


Sachiko

What a nice surprise! I wasn't expecting you home so early.


Light

Yeah. Hi mom. It's because… Huh? Oh, the results of the nationwide exams.


Sachiko

I've been waiting all day.


Light

Here.


Sachiko

Goodness! Number one again! These are the highest scores you've had.


Light

Yeah, I guess. I'm going to study in my room so please don't interrupt me, ok?


Sachiko

As you wish. Oh Light, do you want anything at all, dear? You can ask for whatever you like.


Light

No, I'm fine, Mom. Thanks though. I've already got what I want.




Opens Death Note and observes all the names he's written. Laughs maniacally.


Ryuk

You've taken quite a liking to it.




Light screams and falls over.


Ryuk

No reason to act surprised. I am the Shinigami, Ryuk. That used to be my notebook. Judging by your laughter, you've already figured out that what you have is no ordinary notebook.


Light

Shinigami, a God of Death, huh? Well, I'm not surprised. In fact… Ryuk, I've been waiting for you.


Ryuk

Oh?


Light

I've already figured out that this Death Note that I've found is real. It didn't take me long. And now that I've witnessed the proof of its power, I only feel more confident in what I'm gonna do.


Ryuk

That's interesting. I certainly wasn't expecting this. Several Death Notes have made their way into the human world in the past, but you're the first to have written this many names. Look at how many people you’ve killed in only five days. Most are reluctant to write this much.


Light

I've already prepared myself, Ryuk. I used the notebook even though I knew it belonged to a Shinigami, and now that Shinigami has come. So what will happen to me? You're here to take my soul, right?


Ryuk

Hmm, what do you mean? Is that some fantasy you humans came up with? I'm not gonna do anything to you. The notebook becomes part of the human realm from the very moment it touches the earth. In other words, the notebook is now yours.


Light

This… is mine?


Ryuk

If you don't want it, just give it to someone else. But if you give it away, I'd have no choice but to erase your memories of the notebook.


Light

So, then, you're saying I can use the Death Note all I want and I won't be punished?


Ryuk

Let's just say this, you will feel the fear and pain known only to humans who have used the notebook. And when it's your time to die, it will fall on me to write your name in my Death Note. Be warned, any human who's used a Death Note can neither go to heaven nor hell for eternity. That's all. [Laughs.] Now you have something to look forward to after you die.




Sachiko knocks on the door.


Light

Unh!


Sachiko

Light?


Ryuk

It'll be alright. Answer it.


Light

What is it?


Sachiko

I thought you'd like some apples the neighbors brought them over for us. Why on earth is it so dark in your room? You'll ruin your eyesight.


Light

What's going on? Mom can't see him?


Ryuk

That notebook you found originally belonged to me, and since you're now using it, you are the only one able to see me, and of course, my voice can only be heard by you. In other words, the Death Note is the bond between Light, the human and Ryuk, the Shinigami. [Bites an apple] Yum.


Light

I just have one more question I wanna ask you. Why was I chosen for this? [Ryuk devours two apples] Hey, are you even listening?


Ryuk

Apples in the human world are worth the trip. What's the best way to describe these? Juicy?


Light

Just answer my question?


Ryuk

[Scoffs] I didn't choose you. Don't you see? This is all just an accident. You actually thought you were chosen because you're so smart or something? Don't be so vain. It just happened to fall around here, and you just happened to pick it up. And that's all there is to it. That's why I wrote the instructions in English, the most popular language in the human world.


Light

Then why did you drop it in the first place? You even wrote down specific instructions, so don't try telling me this was an accident!


Ryuk

You're asking me why? I did it 'cause I was bored.


Light

You were bored?


Ryuk

The truth is Shinigami haven't got much to do these days. Most of the time we're either taking naps or gambling. If you take the time to write names in your Death Note, the others just laugh at you for working so hard. Even if you wrote the name of another Shinigami, it'd be pointless because they wouldn't die. And since we live in the Shinigami Realm, it brings us no amusement to kill those in the human world either. So I figured I'd have more fun if I came down here myself. Anyway, I'm surprised at how many names you've written, but I wanna know why you only wrote the cause of death for that guy who was hit by the truck.


Light

If you don't write down the cause of death, the victim dies of a heart attack, and that's probably the best thing about the Death Note, Ryuk. You see, I've already exhausted the list of the world's major criminals, and eventually, I'm going to get rid of them all.


Ryuk

What's the point of doing that?


Light

It's only a matter of time before people figure out that these criminals are being eliminated by someone. I want the world to know of my existence. That there's someone passing righteous judgement on the wicked!


Ryuk

Why even bother? What are you trying to achieve by passing judgement on them. I mean, why do you care?


Light

Because… I've been bored too. I wasn't ready to believe it at first, but it's obvious now. There's something about the Death Note itself that makes humans want to try it out at least once.




Flashback after Taruo's death


Light

I killed them both. I really… I killed to men. Those were human lives, it won't be overlooked. Besides, who am I to pass judgement on others? Uhh… no, no wait. Maybe I'm wrong. This is exactly what I've been thinking about lately. This world is rotting, and those who are making it rot deserve to die. Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it. Because the world can't go on like this.




Flashback in the classroom


Light

I've wondered… what if someone else picked up this notebook. Is there anyone out there, other than me, who would be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, then who will? That's just it; there's no one, but I can do it. In fact, I'm the only one who can. I'll do it, using the Death Note, I'll change the world.




Various criminals groan and die as Light writes their names.


Light

At first, I wrote the names of the worst criminals I could think of. Like I was cleaning up the world, one name at a time, so that eventually no one will ever do anything evil again. And while the truly guilty ones who deserve to be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks, the people who are less guilty but who still make trouble for others will slowly be erased through disease and accidental death. Then and only then the world will start moving in the right direction. It'll be a new world, free of injustice, and populated by people who I've judged to be honest, kind, and hardworking.


Ryuk

But if you did that, it would make you the only bad person left.


Light

Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm a hard working honor student considered to be one of Japan's best and brightest. And I… I will become the God of this New World.


Ryuk

It's just as I thought, humans are so interesting.
