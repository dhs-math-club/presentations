Opening Theme




A montage of scenes from the previous episode plays as relevant dialogue from the episode overlaps




A hand reaches out of a prison cell.Cut to a prison cafeteria. An inmate sitting at a table tears his shirt open and dies.Cut to Soichiro standing at his desk in task force HQ, addressing two reporting officers.


Soichiro

[V.O.] What? I don't believe this. Another twenty-three victims yesterday? Are these confirmed?




L's voice is heard as the screen dissolves to a room in an unknown location. L is leaning back in front of a computer.


L

[V.O.] As soon as began to suspect that Kira might be a student, the pacing of the killings changed, as if to contradict that theory. This can only mean that Kira has access to police information.




Towards the end of L's first sentence, cut to: Light Yagami's bedroom. Light is sitting at his desk and using his computer.


Light

[V.O.] When L discovers that I'm somehow getting confidential information, he'll be obligated to start investigating the police to find the source of the leak.




Towards the end of Light's last sentence, cut to neighborhood streets at night. Ryuk is hovering behind Light, who is walking down the middle of the street.


Ryuk

[V.O.] You're being followed by another human. He's watching you right now.


Light

[V.O.] That's a problem. I'll have to get rid of him as soon as possible.




Cut to Light's bedroom at night


Ryuk

Because through a Shinigami's eyes a human's name can be seen above their head. Not only that, we see there lifespan as well. However, if a Shinigami drops his Death Note, and a human picks it up, he can grant that human the eyes of a Shinigami. The price for having a Shinigami's eyes is half of that person's remaining lifespan. That's all it is. So... what'll it be, Light? Is it a deal?




Title card




Cut to: Shinigami Realm. The scene starts with a closeup of Shinigami 1, who is staring at the sky. The Shinigami's voices echo as they speak.


Shinigami 1

Has anyone seen Ryuk around?




Cut out to the rest of the Shinigami Realm and the Shinigami sitting around. Pan across various Shinigami as they speak.


Shinigami 2

Maybe he was serious about losing his Death Note.


Shinigami 3

[O.S.] It was probably picked up by some human before he could get to it.


Shinigami 4

No way. Then he'd be stuck there 'til the end of that human's life or until the Death Note was destroyed. That could take a while.


Armonia Justin Beyondormason

Yeah. I can't picture Ryuk doing something so boring.


Shinigami 5

[O.S.] Do you know what? I actually heard he was carrying two Death Notes.


Shinigami 6

[O.S.] Seriously, why would he need two?


Armonia Justin Beyondormason

Beats me. I'll never understand that guy.




Fade from black: Human World, Light Yagami's bedroom; a continuation of Light and Ryuk's conversation seen in the intro recap.


Light

So the price for receiving the eyes of the Shinigami is no more than half of my remaining lifespan? [pauses] That's it, right?


Ryuk

Yes. Well then, do we have a deal or not?




Silence as Ryuk and Light stare at each other. Still grinning, Light narrows his eyes.


Light

Ryuk. [pauses] This deal is... out of the question.


Ryuk

Huh?




Cut to the neighborhood outside. The moon shines in the sky and the streets are empty. The sounds of wind and a dog barking in the background.


Light

Let's get this straight. [cut back] My plan is to create an ideal new world free from evil and all criminals, and I intend to reign as a god in that new world for a very long time. I might consider the deal if it lengthened my life, but not if I die sooner. I figured you of all people should know I wouldn't take this deal.


Ryuk

Yeah. I still felt I should tell you that the deal existed, just in case. Anyway, I've done my part. I don't need you complaining I didn't tell you this earlier on.


Light

This is what you call "telling me early on"? Doncha you think you're a little late? I don't see why you couldn't'a told me this when we met. Or better yet, you could've simply included it in the instructions for the Death Note.


Ryuk

Uh, good point. [thinking] He's not the slightest bit daunted by the fact that I'm a Shinigami. He doesn't suck up to me, and he seems to have no problem giving me a hard time.




Cutaway of a Stranger standing behind a streetlight outside looks back at the Yagami house before turning away. Cut back.


Light

[getting up from his desk and walking away] Well, you sure there's nothing else you want to tell me "ahead of time," [pauses as he lays back onto his bed] "Shinigami"?


Ryuk

No, nothing else. [thinking] Eh, probably.


Light

Really? That's too bad.


Ryuk

Whaddya mean?


Light

You know, Ryuk, I might've seriously considered the deal if you'd offered me wings instead of eyes. Just the idea of flying 'round freely in the sky sounds very god-like. After all, it's been mankind's dream since antiquity to be able to fly.


Ryuk

[slightly surprised] You'd stand out if you sprouted wings and flew around. Not to mention the police would have no trouble finding you.


Light

[laughs softly] I was only joking. Anyway, if I keep bargaining for eyes and wings and whatever else, next thing you know I'm going to end up becoming a real Shinigami. Though who knows? I bet that could be pretty interesting.


Ryuk

I wouldn't worry. Even without the eyes and wings, you're already a worthy Shinigami.




Fade from black to Shinigami Realm. Various shots of different Shinigami and the surroundings as Ryuk speaks.


Ryuk

[V.O.] The Shinigami realm is slowly rotting. We lead meaningless and empty lives. And the only reason we still take human lives is because we're afraid to die ourselves. The truth of the matter is that we no longer even know why we exist. In fact, I doubt there's any reason for our existence at all.




Fade to black. Cut back to Light's bedroom


Ryuk

[cont'd] What I'm saying is, compared to that, you're becoming a much more impressive Shinigami.


Light

I don't know about that. I mean, from what you're telling me it, it sounds like I'm doing a lot more work than they are, but uh I don't want to be compared to a Shinigami. I'm a human using this Death Note to make the world a better place for humans. [flips through the Death Note] But I wouldn't necessarily say the Shinigami realm is meaningless to humans either.


Ryuk

Huh? Why do you say that?


Light

Well, just think about it. Whenever a Shinigami like you comes to the human world once ever hundred—no more like every thousand years—the human world changes dramatically. The existence of the Shinigami Realm is extremely significant.


Ryuk

Really?


Light

And you told me just now that the Shinigami realm is slowly rotting, right? Well, when you return from this world, why not use what you've learned here to try and change it for the better?


Ryuk

[after a pause] Well, Light, I'm not sure why I never noticed this until now, but you're quite the positive thinker.


Light

[laughs softly] Yeah, of course I am. That's why I'm using the Death Note to create a better world. You have to be a positive thinker to even attempt something like this.




Light gasps. He has turned the page to the rules written on the back of the cover.


Light

[cont'd] That's it. I got it.


Ryuk

Got what? What's this about?


Light

I think I just figured out how to find out the name of the guy who was following me today.


Ryuk

How're ya gonna do that?


Light

I'm gonna use the rules of the Death Note to my advantage. I already know that if I write down a cause of death, I've got six minutes and forty seconds to record the conditions and exact time of death. First, I need to know exactly how far I can go in terms of specifying the details of death. ...This should be interesting.




Cut to: Central Government Building No. 2. White kanji reading "next morning" fades in. A phone rings.Cut to the task force headquarters inside. Soichiro picks up the phone. He occasionally pauses to listen to the person on the other end of the line.


Soichiro

Yeah, it's me. ...Another six inmates were found dead last night? ...All were heart attacks? It's him... What? [an officer gasps] Bizarre behavior before they died? Could you be more specific? What do you mean? So they didn't just die from heart attacks.




Cut to the people on the other end of the line. Two men sit at a desk, and one slides a paper over to the man on the phone.


Caller

No, what I'm saying is they all died of heart attacks, but it wasn't quite that simple.




Cut to the desk's surface with closeups of the evidence the Caller is going through. As he reports the deaths, he shifts through the evidence pertaining to each. The first piece of evidence is a photo of a cell with a bloody pentagram painted on the wall.


Caller

[cont'd] Before one of them died, he drew a pentagram on the wall of his cell with his own blood. [letter] Another left a letter, but it doesn't seem to be a will or anything meaningful. [photo] As for the third victim, he escaped from his cell and ran all the way to the staff bathrooms before he died.




Cut to: L's location. The desktop on the floor beeps. L, his face cut off, off walks over and kneels in front of it. There's a beep as he pulls up a video chat window showing Watari' shadowed figure.


L

What is it, Watari?


Watari

[muffled output] Three more heart attack victims, but the circumstances of their deaths are different from what we've seen thus far.


L

What do you mean by "different"?


Watari

[muffled output] I'm sending you a copy of a letter as well as pictures taken at the scene.


L

Okay.




There is beeping as images of the previously seen evidence appear on the computer monitor. L pauses to read the letter.


L

It sounds like he was afraid that Kira would fine him. It's believable that our victim might have been genuinely afraid and wrote this, but... We know Kira can control the time of death. What if he can also determine the actions in the moments leading up to death? In which case...




Cut to task force headquarters at that same moment


L

[distorted by voice changer] Here.


Soichiro

[standing up] Huh?


L

[distorted] We can't release details of these men's deaths to the media. As far as they're concerned, these are just heart attacks.


Soichiro

Huh...


L

[distorted] I have reason to believe that Kira was performing some kind of "test" using these criminals. And if that's the case, we'd only be giving him the results of this information if we put it public.


Soichiro

Right. I understand.


Officer 1

So now he's experimenting on his victims?


Officer 2

Horrible.


Soichiro

He's playing with people's lives, as if all this was just a game. It's unforgivable.




Cut to L's location


L

If Kira is really using criminals as test subjects... what is he trying to achieve?




Fade to black




Cut to: Light's bedroom. Light is at his computer. The computer beeps as he pulls up an image of the previously seen picture of the bloody pentagram on the prison wall.


Light

Look at this, Ryuk. I think we're in luck. The results of yesterday's little "test" of ours has been downloaded onto my dad's computer. And these results are just as I suspected. The Death Note will work for what I have in mind.


Ryuk

Whaddya mean by that?




"Light's Theme" plays




Split screen. The left half shows Light, and the right half starts as black, then fades into the previously seen image of the picture of a dead criminal on the floor.


Light

One of 'em escaped and ran into the bathroom I had specified in the Death Note.




Light's half cuts away to a closeup of a page in the Death Note that has the instructions of death written down, which includes a drawing of a pentagram. The other half of the screen is replaced with the previous image of the picture of a prison cell with a pentagram painted on the wall in blood.


Light

[cont'd] [V.O.] Another one drew the same symbol I had drawn in the bathroom before he died. And finally [the half of the screen with the cell is replaced with the previously seen letter] a third wrote the same letter I had written in the Death Note, word for word.




Cut to black and fade in back to Light's bedroom


Light

[cont'd] All three did exactly what I intended them to do. For the other three inmates, I purposely wrote conditions that were virtually impossible.


Ryuk

Huh?




Cut to closeup of the Death Note with corresponding text filled-in dissolves into the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Various images, including relevant, filled-in Death Note pages; diagrams; and images of the dead criminals appear in various split screen positions as Light explains his experiments.


Light

With the first one, I wrote that he would die in front of the Eiffel Tower in one hour. However, everyone knows it's physically impossible to go from a prison in Japan to Paris, France in only one hour. Since this couldn't happen, he simply died of a heart attack in prison. The next was supposed to draw an exact picture of L's face on the prison wall. This also didn't happen. You can't draw someone you've never seen before.


Ryuk

[O.S.] Makes sense.




Fade to black and cut to closeup of the Death Note with the third tested death written in the corner.


Light

[V.O.] With the last one, I tried something slightly different. I specified that he would write a note that read, "I know that L is suspicious of the Japanese police."




Cut back to Light


Light

[cont'd] To be honest, I actually expected this one to work, but it didn't end up happening. Which means, it's impossible to make someone write what they don't already know. Or at the very least, it has to be the kind of thing they could come up with on their own. Basically, even the Death Note can't do the impossible, but as long as it's within the realistic limits of what that person might do, I can control them as much as I want before they die.


Ryuk

That's very clever. But what's all this leading to? What's the point?


Light

These latest victims will no doubt keep L and the police guessing. Even as we speak, he's probably trying to decipher all the clues I left for him. Especially that little note. That absolutely meaningless dying message.




Cut to: L's location. L is crouching in front of a computer, the light of the monitor being the only thing illuminating the room.


L

If Kira used those criminals to start an experiment of some sort, it means he's about to start something. If he moves now, there's a good chance the FBI will notice someone acting. But perhaps he has a different goal in mind altogether.




Cut to computer monitor, with images of the pentagram and letter pictures pulled up next to each other


L

[cont'd] [O.S.] Could the pentagram and this letter be some kind of message?




Cut back to L; "Light's Theme" comes to an abrupt stop and L gasps. Cut to a closeup of the letter on the monitor, followed by a shrill as the first row of the letter is highlighted.]


L

[cont'd] [O.S.] Is this it?




 Brief pre-lap; as Light says the first word of his sentence, cut to: Light's room in the daytime. Light is working at his computer.


Light

Alright. Time for the real thing.


Ryuk

"Real thing"?


Light

Yesterday on the news they said this drug addict tried to rob a bank but was unsuccessful.




Cut to the bottom of Light's computer monitor. As Light speaks, pan up until the monitor reveals a picture of the criminal mentioned on the news. Under the picture is kanji reading "指名手配犯 (wanted criminal) 恐田奇一郎 (Kiichiro Osoreda).


Light

[cont'd] [O.S.] He attacked a few people and then ran away emptyhanded. I'll use him.




Cut to Light, who pulls out his cellphone and starts punching in numbers


Light

[cont'd] It's kinda last minute, but I'm sure I can find someone. I got a few people in mind.


Ryuk

"A few people." For what?


Light

You'll see. [putting phone to his ear] Believe it or not, I'm actually a rather popular guy, Ryuk.




Cut to exterior of an unknown house; the sound of a cell phone ringing. Cut to a room inside; a girl (Yuri) lying in bed grabs her ringing cellphone and picks it up, remaining buried under the covers. She occasionally pauses while Light talks on the other end.


Yuri

Hello? ...Huh? Light? Oh, morning.




Eyecatch out – "The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell."




Eyecatch in – "If the time of death is written within 40seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40seconds after writing the name."




Cut to: an outdoor public area; there are various people scattered about. Light is walking down a stairway. Light glances back to check that the Stranger is still following him.


Light

[thinking] He's still following me. This whole thing would just be a waste of time if he wasn't following me.




Cut to Yuri at the bus stop, standing under a bus shelter. She is looking at her cellphone. A bus drives by. Yuri looks up as Light approaches in the distance. Ryuk is flying behind him.


Yuri

[waving] [calls out] Light!


Ryuk

A date?


Light

Yeah.




Yuri is still under the bus shelter, waving at Light. She laughs happily.


Light

[cont'd] It's a date no matter how you look at it. I'm sure even my stalker will see it that way.


Ryuk

But this isn't just a date, is it? You said that you'd figured out a way o find your stalkers name. So tell me, what do you plan on doing?


Light

Huh? Come on, didn't you see what I wrote in the Death Note? I explained it in great detail.


Ryuk

No. Doing that would take all the fun out of it.


Light

In that case, just be patient and watch what happens. [he approaches the bus shelter; to Yuri:] Sorry, did I keep you waiting?


Yuri

No, not at all. Anyway, I haven't been to Space Land since junior high! [clings to Light's arm] I'm so excited. And the best part is I have you all to myself!


Light

Uh, yeah.




The Stranger is watching them in the shadows behind a nearby stairway


Stranger

[thinking] During the week he goes to school and cram school at night.




Light and Yuri are talking and laughing as the Stranger thinks.


Stranger

[cont'd] [thinking] Dates on his day off. Normal kid, just a hardworking senior in high school. Chief Yagami's son, Light Yagami. [Stranger jots down notes in small notebook] No cause for suspicion.




The Stranger looks up. The sound of a bus stopping, and then Light and Yuri are seen stepping onto the bus. The stranger walks towards the bus.


Stranger

[cont'd] [thinking] At any rate, I'll be done with my surveillance today, and that'll be it.




Dissolve to some point later on. Light and Yuri are sitting at a seat on the bus.


Yuri

I don't get it, Light. Didn't you say you weren't going out until entrance exams were over?




Towards the end of her sentence, the Stranger walks passed her and Light and sits in the seat behind them


Light

That was before I scored number one on the national practice exams.


Yuri

[groans] [playfully] You're such a nerd. [giggles]




Dissolve to some point later on. Music plays and there are shots of various people on the bus. Yuri talking noiselessly, the Stranger sitting behind her and Light, Light with his eyes closed.Cut to aerial view of a bus stop, where one man waits. The bus pulls up and stops, and the music comes to a calm end before cutting back to the interior of the bus. The man enters; it is the man from the article previously seen on Light's computer: Kiichiro Osoreda. He walks towards the front of the bus, and Light has taken notice of him.


Light

[thinking] It's him. He's here. Seven passengers excluding him, no one's in the way. Everything should go smoothly.




Osoreda cocks his gun, then points it at the bus driver (Sasaki), who gasps. Osoreda addresses everyone on the bus.


Osoreda

Stay in your seats unless you want to die.




A woman makes small a small cry in fear


Stranger

[thinking] A bus jacking? You gotta be kidding me.


Osoreda

Everybody shut up! If anybody moves, I'm putting a bullet in their head. [to Sasaki] Alright, driver, you listen to me. I know you've got the number for Space Land's office on ya. Call 'em!


Sasaki

O-okay.




Cut to the front wheel of the bus, which is still spinning as it continues down the road.


Sasaki

[on the phone] This-this is Sasaki, calling from Bus 1-7-4. [cut back]


Osoreda

Tell 'em what's going on—and no tricks, either.


Sasaki

M-my bus has been hijacked, and he's holding a gun to my head.


Osoreda

[grabbing phone from Sasaki] Gimme that. [on the phone] You heard what he said. Now you listen up!




Still holding the phone to his face, Osoreda turns and points his gun at the bus passengers.


Osoreda

Have a female staff member bring all the cash from Space Land's cash from yesterday. I know it's there. Have her meet us two bus stops from the park and don't make me wait. If you try to mess with me at all or try to get the police involved, I swear I'll kill everyone one of these passengers.




Yuri is quaking in fear, her hands clasped, and her eyes shut tight. Light taps her thigh, and she opens her eyes and looks at him.


Yuri

Huh?




Light holds up a small piece of paper for her to see. His voice is heard saying what's written on the note.


Light

[V.O.] Yuri, don't be scared. As soon as he turns around, I'm going to grab the gun out of his hand.




Light purposely held the note so that the Stranger could also see. Having read the note, the Stranger leans forward to talk to Light. Light and Yuri look back at him when he starts talking.


Stranger

Don't be stupid. That's risky. [leans closer] If it comes to that, I'll take care of it.




Light looks away and starts writing on the paper


Stranger

It's okay. We don't have to pass notes back and forth. As long as we keep it down, he won't be able to hear our voices over the sound of the engine.




Light crumples up the paper and stuffs it into his pocket.


Light

Do you have any proof you're not his accomplice? Why should we trust you?




The Stranger gasps and stiffens


Yuri

[timidly] Accomplice?


Light

Yes, I've read about this before. The first hijacker comes in like he's working alone. Meanwhile, the second one pretends to be a hostage and stays in the very back just in case something goes wrong. [softly] What's the matter.


Yuri

[softly] You... you really think he is one?


Stranger

[thinking] I... I have no choice. I'm sure Light Yagami isn't Kira. If he was, he could just kill this guy with a heart attack.




He hands Light his wallet containing his FBI badge and ID


Stranger

Here's my proof. [Light takes it] Take a look.




Light holds up the wallet and looks at the ID


Light

[thinking] FBI? I see. L needed an outsider, so he got the FBI to investigate anyone connected to the Japanese Police Force. His name is... Raye Penber.




Light grins, then quickly composes himself and hands the Stranger—Raye Penber—back his ID


Light

I trust you. And I guess for the time being I won't bother asking what an FBI agent is doing on the bus in the first place. Do you have a gun?


Raye

Yeah, I've got one.


Light

So if it comes down to it, I can rely on you, right?


Raye

Yes.




Osoreda approaches an elderly couple. The man gasps, and the woman whimpers in fear, leaning into her husband.


Osoreda

Get the hell up, you old hag! You want me to shoot you right now?


Raye

[gasps] [thinking] That's right. This guy. His face was all over the local news just a few days ago.




Raye's thoughts continue over Osoreda, who says the following


Osoreda

Look at me when I'm talking to you, grandma! I said shut up! [growls]


Raye

[cont'd] [thinking] Some junkie. He tried to rob a bank and then killed three people before he got away. He's extremely dangerous.


Light

[smugly thinking] We're safe. He won't shoot us. In fact, he's not gonna do anything.




Light purposely makes a crumpled-up note fall out of his pocket and onto the floor. He leans down to pick it up, gasping in fake concern. Osoreda notices and points his gun at Light.


Osoreda

[shouting] Don't move, you little punk!




Light looks up at Osoreda


Osoreda

[shouting] What the hell is that? [pause] Eh, smartass! [picking up note] You guys were planning something back here, weren'cha?


Raye

[thinking] Damn it! If he sees that note from before, he'll find out that Light was planning to jump him and take his gun away!




Osoreda silently reads the note. It is not the paper from earlier. Date plans are written on the note in kanji.


Osoreda

Pft. Plans for a date, huh? [crumples and tosses note to Light] Stupid kid.




He turns around to look at Light, crumples the note and walks away. Light smirks slightly and tightens his grip on the crumpled paper.


Light

[thinking] Gotcha.




The engine of the bus briefly roars as the bus goes under a bridge. The music shifts to something dark and sinister, the bus is dark for a moment, with Ryuk's shadow visible. Once things return to normal, Osoreda turns around to look at the passengers.


Osoreda

Huh?




His eyes widens, and he gasps. He breathes heavily and panic and backs up, pulling out his gun, cocking it, and pointing it. From now on, he shouts, his voice frantic.


Osoeda

[shouting frantically] Wh-who the hell are you? You in the very back? What do you think you're doing?




Raye Penber, his hand reaching in his coat for a gun, inhales sharply and his eyes widen


Osoreda

[shouting frantically] Don't mess with me!




Ryuk is now visible in the back of the bus


Osoreda

[shouting frantically] How long have you been hiding back there?


Ryuk

What's this? [tilts head] You're talking to me? [steps forward] So you mean you can actually see me right now?


Osoreda

[gasps] Stay there, you! You—Keep away from me, you freak!


Raye

[thinking] This isn't good. He's hallucinating! [quickly leans forward] [shouting] Everyone! Get down!




The passengers gasp and scream as they brace themselves. Light grabs Yuri and pulls her down with him, leaning forward. Ryuk is hit with realization. 


Ryuk

Oh, I get it! That little note that Light "accidentally" dropped, was actually torn from the pages of the Death Note itself. Since he tricked this guy into TOUCHING the paper, he's the only other one on the bus who can see me. [walking towards Osoreda] That's so smart!


Osoreda

[stumbling back] [shouting frantically] Get away!




He takes two shots at Ryuk, letting out cries each time. The first shot misses Ryuk and goes through a window, and the second goes through him.


Soichiro

Sorry, pal. I'm a Shinigami, so I'm afraid your bullets aren't gonna kill me.




Osoreda screams and shoots Ryuk five times. Each bullet goes through Ryuk, and the fifth shatters the window at the back of the bus. Osoreda's screams die down, and he continues to pull the trigger but is out of bullets. He stops pulling the trigger but continues to point the gun at Ryuk. His frantic gasps of fear continue and can be heard under Ryuk's dialogue.


Ryuk

"Anyone who touches the Death Note can see me." "I have to stay 'til the Death Note is finished or you die—whichever comes first." And "a Shinigami can't die from being shot." I've said all these things at one time or another. Well, he is the top-ranked student in the country. [Raye gets up from his seat and runs forward] He even used this hijacking as a way to get the guy following him to willingly give up his name.




Raye runs past Ryuk and towards Osoreda. Osoreda runs forward, panting, then stops behind Sasaki, wrapping his arms around him


Osoreda

Stop the bus. [shouting] Let me off!




The bus screeches to a stop, tilting and hitting the curb. The door opens and Osoreda runs out onto the street, falling to his knees. The sinister music comes to a stop. Tires can be heard screeching against pavement. Osoreda turns his head and sees a car attempting to come to a halt. The screen cuts away to a building, and the crashing of the car is heard. Everything is silent.After a pause, cut back to the bus. Raye is standing at the open door of the bus, shocked. Sasaki is next to him, staring horrified. Yuri is looking out the window with an almost blank expression. Two other passengers look out the window in shock. After a moment, Light pulls down his coat sleeve and looks at his watch.


Light

[thinking] Eleven forty-five on the dot. Everything went just as I planned.




Cut to black. Fade into the image of Kiichiro Osoreda's wanted image on Light's computer monitor.


Light

[cont'd] [V.O.] "Kiichiro Osoreda. Accidental death."




Cut to scene with aerial view of Osoreda at bus station. A montage of scenes from the incident before superimposes an image of the filled-out Death Note entry on Osoreda's death.


Light

[cont'd] [V.O.] "Boards the 11:31 Space Land-bound bus near the eastern entrance to the park, holding a loaded gun, and attempts to hijack the bus. He sees a horrific phantom and empties his gun trying to kill it. Terrified, he leaves the bus. Immediately afterwards, at 11:45, he dies when struck by a car."




Freeze frame of Osoreda's face as he stares at the approaching car. Fade to black. Fade in from black to a closeup of the pavement. Osoreda's hand is visible and his blood flows on the pavement.


Light

[cont'd] [thinking] The Death Note never fails. [cut to Raye] You will be next, Raye Penber.




Cut to previous shot of Osoreda's hand on the bloody pavement.




"TO BE CONTINUED"




Next episode preview


Light

[V.O.] It's just as I thought. He doesn't suspect me at all. The remaining investigators will all die of heart attack. Farewell, Raye Penber.




Ending credits
