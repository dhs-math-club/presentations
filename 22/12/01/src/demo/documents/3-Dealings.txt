Opening chants


L

Greetings to all of you at the ICPO. I…am L. Whether the guilty party is an individual or a group, there's a strong possibility that they are Japanese.


Lind L. Tailor

Kira, I've got a pretty good idea what your motivation might be, and I can guess what you hope to achieve. However, what you're doing right now is evil.


Light

You…you bastard.


L

Now…try to kill me!


Light

I am justice! I protect the innocent and those who fear evil! I'm the one who will become the god of a new world that everyone desires!


Officer 1 (talking over Light)

What the hell is going on? L is taking this too far.


L (talking over Light)

Go ahead! Come on, right now! Kill me!


Light

L…


L

Kira…




Split screen


Both Light and L

I will hunt you down wherever you're hiding, and I will eliminate you!


Light

I am…


L

I am…


Both

Justice!




Task Force headquarters


Soichiro

All right. Let's start with the tip line reports.


Mogi

Yes, sir. Up to this point, we've received three thousand twenty-nine responses about the murders via telephone and e-mail. Most of these have been curious citizens and prank calls, but there are fourteen people who claimed to either know Kira or who have seen him. All fourteen accounts were followed up on and carefully documented. However, nobody could provide any information that wasn't already publicly available. And lastly, this week there were additional twenty-one people who called in claiming to be Kira.


Soichiro

Huh. [Clears throat]


Mogi

We didn't wanna rule anything out. So we followed standard procedure and created files for all twenty-one of them.


Soichiro

Uh huh. All right. On to the victim reports.


Officer 2

Yes, sir. Upon further investigation, we have confirmed that information of the heart attack victims was in fact publicly available in Japan immediately prior to their deaths. Also, concerning L's request that we investigate the time of death for each victim, we found that all of them occurred between the hours of 4 p.m. and 2 a.m. on weekdays, local time, with sixty-eight percent of them occurring between 8 p.m. and 12 a.m. Weekends and holidays appeared to be the exception to this rule as the times of deaths vary much more widely than during the week.


L

[Through voice modifier] That information is extremely relevant for us. It suggests that, given the times of death, our suspect could very well be a student.


Soichiro

Hmm?


L

Based on the fact that Kira is only killing criminals, I think it's safe to assume that he is driven by a very idealistic notion of justice. It's highly possible he may even aspire to be some sort of godlike figure. We're dealing with the individual who has a very childish concept of right and wrong. Of course, this is mere speculation at this point, but still, I recommend you re-examine any assumptions you've made as to whether or not our suspect could be a student. We must consider every possibility. I believe that's the shortest route to finding and arresting Kira. Please, continue with your report.


Soichiro

Hm. Oh right. Does anyone else have something they'd like to add?


Matsuda

Um, yes sir.


Soichiro

What is it, Matsuda?


Matsuda

Um…well I'm not saying this to support Kira or to condone the murders, but…in the last few days throughout the world, but especially here in Japan, we've observed the dramatic decrease in the number of violent crimes committed.


Soichiro

Well, I suppose it makes sense. We've suspected something like that would happen. Anything else?


Matsuda

No.


Soichiro

Well, that about sums up our report for today. L?


L

Thank you, everyone. I feel we're one step closer to finding Kira. Before I go, I'm afraid I have one additional request to make. This is directed to the teams investigating the victims, TV news, and internet: I would like you to go back and take a closer look at the exact way in which the victims' identities were made public. Be as thorough as possible. In particular, I want to know if photos of the victims were made available to the public in Japan. I'll leave it to you.


Soichiro

[Stretching] Ah… ah…


Matsuda

Chief!


Soichiro

Hm?


Matsuda

You look like you could use one of these. Sleeping much?


Soichiro

Ah. Thank you. That'll do the trick. I feel all these late nights are starting to take their toll. [Sips coffee] Ah.


Matsuda

About what I said earlier at our meeting…well, now that I think about it, um, I'm sure everyone already knew that. I wanted to apologize.


Soichiro

What on earth are you talking about? Nobody said it'll be easy to speak the truth, but it has to be done. Especially when it is something that isn't easy to say.


Matsuda

Ha?


Soichiro

Having said that, if you had gone on to say that we should commend Kira for doing such a great job of reducing violent crime, then yes, I might have had a little problem with that.


Matsuda

Oh, no. No, I wouldn't. That would never happen!


Soichiro

[Laughs] Just kidding.




Yagami household, in Light's bedroom


Sayu

I knew I can count on you, Light.


Light

Hey, so do you think you're ready to try a few on your own now?


Sayu

Huh? Yeah. I guess so. Oh, sounds like Dad's home.




Downstairs


Sachiko

Welcome home, dear.


Soichiro

Thank you.




Back in Light's room


Sayu

He's home really early today.


Light

Hey, why don't you at least try the last problem by yourself?


Sayu

I will, but maybe after dinner.




Sayu exits.


Light

Yeah, right.


Ryuk

Helping your sister with her homework, you sure are relaxed.


Light

Of course. If the police try to come after me, I'm pretty confident I've got something that'll give me the advantage.




Downstairs in the dining room


Light

Hey, glad you can join us for dinner. You hungry, Dad?


Soichiro

Yeah. It's been a long day.




Scene change to Light's family eating dinner as Ryuk watches


Soichiro

So, Light, tell me. How are your studies going?


Light

Hm? Everything's okay, I guess.


Sayu

Whatever. He's at the top of his class. My big brother is a genius!


Sachiko

That's my son! We're all proud of you, Light.


Light

Is everything okay, Dad? You look tired.


Soichiro

Yeah. I'm not able to say too much about it, but this case I'm working on now is really tough.




Light's room


Ryuk

[Thinks] I see. Well, well. Daddy's a policeman. And that must be the reason why you're so confident?


Light

That's right. It's easy for me to hack into Dad's computer. We're on a home network, so I can copy the files I need without leaving a trace. This way, I can keep track of their investigation. Here we go. Well, isn't that interesting? Looks like the police are already beginning to suspect a student.


Ryuk

[Laughs] I guess that means you are in trouble.


Light

If the cause of death is written within forty seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next six minutes and forty seconds. That sound right to you, Ryuk?


Ryuk

So what's your point?


Light

In other words, if I write heart attacks as the cause of death, then I should be able to write down all the details including time of death afterward, shouldn't I? Looks like I will be able to provide you with more entertainment now.




Scene changes to Light walking outside and then changes to a prison. An inmate is grunting and sticks his hand out of his cell, then dies. Light is then shown playing a soccer match, but it soon changes to another prison where several inmates are lined up.


Inmate

[Grunts]


Officer

Inmate 148, what's wrong? Snap out of it!




Scene changes to Light taking his food out of a bad and opening his lunch while it cuts to another inmate ripping his shirt and gasping for air as he dies in the prison cafeteria.




Task Force headquarters


Soichiro

What? I-I don't believe this. Another twenty-three victims yesterday? Are these confirmed?


Officer 1

Yes.


Soichiro

The day before there were another twenty-three victims. He's killing one off, every hour on the hour.


Officer 2

Considering that this new pattern has been going on for two weekdays…


Officer 1

It does punch some holes in the theory that our suspect is a student.


Officer 3

Maybe not. Anybody can skip two days of school.


L

[Through voice modifier] You're missing the point.


Soichiro

Huh?


Task Force members

Huh?


L

It does appear less likely now that Kira is a student, but that's not the message he's sending by doing this.


Matsuda

Ah!


L

Ask yourselves, why every hour? And why are all these victims in prisons where they should be discovered immediately? Why not other criminals like before? I believe Kira is telling us that not only can he kill from a distance, but he can also determine the time of death. But something's not right. As soon as we began to suspect that Kira might be a student, the pacing of the killings changed. As if to contradict that theory. Coincidence? No. Too convenient. This can only mean that Kira has access to police information. It's obvious now. This is a direct challenge to me.




Light's room


Light

I'd say L is probably starting to sweat a little by now. What'll really make his job difficult is that I've deliberately left about fifty criminals alive for times like this.


Ryuk

Oh?


Light

If L is as good as they say, by now, he should be starting to suspect someone with connections to the police.




Unknown location


L

So Kira has found a way to obtain information from the Task Force headquarters. This is one fact that cannot be ignored. But what does he get out of all this? What is he hoping to achieve in the end?




Light's room


Ryuk

There's one thing I don't get. Showing them you have connections to the police makes it easier for them to find you than when they just suspected you a student.


Light

Well, my real agenda is…to get close to L, so I can eliminate him.


Ryuk

How are you gonna do that?


Light

You still don't understand human beings. In this world, there are very few people who actually trust each other. And it's no different for the police, you know. What's especially important is that L and the investigators don't trust each other at all. Think about it. Could you trust someone whose name and face you don't even know? When L discovers that I'm somehow getting confidential information, he'll be obligated to start investigating the police to find the source of the leak. When that happens, it'll only be a matter of time before the police start resenting L. On the surface, it will appear that L and the investigation team are working together to try to catch me. But in reality, L will investigate the police, and they will be investigating L. I'm not the one who is going to find L. I can let the police do that for me. And when they do, that's when I'll eliminate him.




Commercial break




Task Force headquarters


Soichiro

What's this about?


Officer 1

With all due respect, Chief, we are resigning.


Officer 2

We demand that you assign us to a different case. Otherwise, you can have our badges right here and now.


Soichiro

Why? You're good cops!


Officer 1

Isn't it clear? It's because we value our lives, sir.


Officer 2

If what L says is true, Kira has some ESP-like power that somehow allows him to kill people indirectly from anywhere.


Officer 3

Well, if I were Kira, sir, I'd probably wanna trying to get rid of the people who are trying to catch me.


Officer 2

Let's face it, he knows he will be sentenced to death if he's caught.


Officer 1

We all sat here and watched when L decided to pull that media stunt and challenge Kira to kill him. Well, it was all very impressive at the time, but then again, L never had to show his face or reveal his name for that matter. I'm sure you recall L's last request? He asked that we take a closer look at how these victims' identities were made public and specifically to determine whether photos of the victims were available to the public prior to their deaths. Well, it turns out he was right! Every single one of those victims' names and photos were broadcast to the Japanese public, and then they died! Unlike someone we know, we are out there investigating this case wearing police IDs with our names and photos on them! Anybody with a computer can find out who we are! We don't hide our faces! We're out in the open!


Officer 3

Sir, the truth is, we could be killed by Kira at any time.


Officer 1

For these reasons, we refuse to continue working this case. Excuse us, Chief.


Soichiro

Hey, stop! All of you, hold it right there!




Scene change to L watching his computer screen, then Ryuk with Light in Daikoku Private Academy


Ryuk

Huh?


Math professor

In order to solve this problem, we must establish the concept that X squared equals large X. Now pay attention because this is important. Before we tackle more complex quadratic equations, we have to start thinking of large X's value as simply the multiple of two integers. Now let's apply this concept to our first problem.




Unknown location


Watari

We brought the FBI to Japan four days ago. They are fully operational. As requested, they're now gathering intel on the police.


L

And this is the complete list?


Watari

Yes.


L

[Thinking] There are one hundred forty-one people in the police force who have access to classified information regarding the investigation. I am sure that somewhere in this list of the police officers and the people closest to them, we will find our suspect.




Streets, Light is walking and Ryuk is hovering beside him


Ryuk

Light, you got a second?


Light

I've already told you, Ryuk. You can't talk to me in public. How many times do I have to tell you?


Ryuk

In that case, I'll talk, you just listen. If you don't want to hear me, you can plug your ears or something. First of all, I don't have anything against you. I actually think the notebook couldn't have been picked up by a better person. I'm here 'cause I have to stick around till the Death Note is finished or I see you die, whichever comes first. But make no mistake, Light, I'm not on your side or L's side.


Light

Yeah. Well, I knew that much already.


Ryuk

You'll never hear me say anything about whether what you're doing is right or wrong. I'm not here to support you or give you my opinion. I'm just a spectator, but as your roommate, I might have a few things to say now and then.


Light

What's this about, Ryuk? Why are you telling me all this stuff now, anyway? It's really not like you.


Ryuk

It's just that I'm no ally of yours, or Kira's, if you prefer. The only reason I'm going to tell you this is because, personally, it is starting to creep me out.


Light

Get to the point already.


Ryuk

[Laughs] You are being followed by another human. He's watching you right now. It's really starting to get on my nerves. I realize there's no way he can see me, but, because I'm always following behind you wherever you go, I feel like I'm constantly being watched.


Light

That's a problem. I'll have to get rid of him as soon as possible.




Light's room


Light

[Thinking] Who would be following me? Does this mean L is already starting to suspect the police? If he's gonna investigate the police, he'll need a lot of resources and manpower. Even if he has as many as fifty people on the case, I don't see how they could ever figure out that I'm Kira. I shouldn't look like anything other than your average high school senior. But the longer I let this person keep following me, the greater the chance is they'll figure out who I really am. Above all, I need my stalker's name. Once I figure that out, I can get rid of him for good.


Ryuk

Light, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. What makes a Shinigami and a human who has a Death Note different? Well, there are two things. And why do Shinigami have to write the names of humans in their Death Notes? You got any ideas?


Light

Of course not. Why would I know that? You know, you sure are talkative today.


Ryuk

It's because we are able to take human lifespans for ourselves.


Light

Huh? Wait, what do you mean by that?


Ryuk

Let's say you have a human who is due to live until the age of sixty and a God of Death wrote that this person would die at forty. Sixty minus forty equals twenty. Now those twenty years taken from someone in the human world are added to that god of death's life.


Light

Huh.


Ryuk

So it means that as long as we don't slack off, even if someone was to shoot us in the head, or stab us in the heart with a knife, a god of death cannot die. On the other hand, no matter how many names you write in your Death Note, your lifespan will not increase. That is the first difference between gods of death and humans who possess a Death Note.


Light

[Laughs] That's something about Shinigami that I haven't heard before. Pretty interesting stuff.


Ryuk

The second difference between us will probably be of even greater interest to you. Though this has less to do with lengthening life and more to do with cutting it short.


Light

What do you mean cutting it short?


Ryuk

Shinigami can tell what the person's name is by just looking at their face. We know instantly. And do you have any idea why? Because through a Shinigami's eyes, a human's name can be seen above their head. Not only that, we see their lifespan as well.


Light

Their name and lifespan?


Ryuk

That's right. I'm able to see your name and lifespan right now. If I converted that to human time, I could tell you how many years you got left. But there's no way I'd ever tell you that. I may have a big mouth, but even I wouldn't go that far. [Laughs] Shinigami never have to worry that they won't be able to kill a person just because they don't know their name, and every time we do take a life, we always know exactly how many years we are going to receive. Our eyes just aren't the same, and that is the difference between you and I. However, if a Shinigami drops his Death Note and a human picks it up, he can grant that human the eyes of a Shinigami, but only if a deal is made, one that has been with us since ancient times.


Light

And what's the deal?


Ryuk

The price for having the Shinigami's eyes…is half of that person's remaining lifespan. That's all it is.


Light

Half of my remaining lifespan?


Ryuk

Yeah. In other words, if you are supposed to live another fifty years, it'll be twenty-five. If it was one more year, then six months.


Light

I see. And since you've made it clear you're not on anyone's side, you won't help me out. You wouldn't just give me the names of people I want to kill. Basically, you're saying that I can't simply borrow your powers. I'd have to pay for them.


Ryuk

That's right. It's a key part of the code that all Shinigami are bound by. I'll say this once more. Give me half your remaining lifespan, and I'll give you the Shinigami Eyes.


Light

If I agree, I'll be able to know everyone's name just by looking at them. If I had that power, the Death Note would only be easier to use.


Ryuk

So, what'll it be, Light? Is it a deal?

Light

Everything has turned out exactly as I wrote it in the Death Note to the last detail. 11:45 on the dot. Everything is going just as I planned. The Death Note never fails.
